# SpatialData

This project aims to work with spatial data collection and spatial data queries using ArcGIS, PostGIS, and Google Earth. The data has been visualized using Google Earth. This requires uploading a KML file, an XML-type extension. 

In this project, I have collected (lat, long) coordinates of various places near the USC campus, such as food joints, libraries, entrance gates, and Fountains. The data has been plotted on Google Earth as seen in the first image.
